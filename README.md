## What are NAMs?

**New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)** are modern, human-relevant, non-animal methods for preclinical drug development. They include a variety of tools such as:

- **In vitro systems**:Organ-on-chip, 3D cell cultures, Organoids  
- **In silico models**: Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD), Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK), Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), AI/ML, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)    
- **Hybrid/combinatorial methods**:  Integration of in vitro and in silico for improved prediction

## Why are NAMs Important?

- **High clinical failure rates**:  
  Over 90% of drugs fail in clinical trials due to poor translation from animal data.
- **Scientific limitations**:  
  Animal models often lack disease relevance and human-specific biology.
- **Ethical concerns**:  
  Growing public and regulatory resistance to animal testing.
- **Financial impact**:  
  Failed translation drives up R&D costs (average ~$985 million per approved drug).
- **Regulatory support**:  
  Agencies like FDA, EMA, and ICH now endorse and encourage NAMs (e.g., FDA Modernization Act 3.0).
